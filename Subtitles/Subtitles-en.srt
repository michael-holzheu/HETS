00:00:19,463 --> 00:00:26,554
You must have heard of
Herman Hollerith or of his work.

2
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:31,710
Sure, of course!
Hollerith was born 1860 in America

3
00:00:31,711 --> 00:00:34,829
as son of German emigrants

4
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:38,373
graduated there as
a mining engineer

5
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:43,038
and started looking
at statistics early on.

6
00:00:43,039 --> 00:00:46,889
For example, in the 1880 census:

7
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,809
The lot of manual work when
evaluating the questionnaires

8
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,929
with the help of tally
sheets made him thoughtful.

9
00:00:54,930 --> 00:01:01,462
Couldn't machines help to reduce the
almost ten-year evaluation period?

10
00:01:01,463 --> 00:01:05,116
A key issue was data collection

11
00:01:05,117 --> 00:01:08,405
what he was looking
for a good medium for

12
00:01:08,406 --> 00:01:12,418
that was suitable for
subsequent machine processing.

13
00:01:12,419 --> 00:01:16,005
On a trip he watched how
the conductor with pliers

14
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,275
on the ticket
through perforations

15
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:21,424
recorded various
characteristics of the passengers.

16
00:01:21,425 --> 00:01:24,767
For example,
gender or skin color.

17
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:29,028
This finally gave him an idea:

18
00:01:29,029 --> 00:01:32,818
The principle could
also be used for statistics

19
00:01:32,819 --> 00:01:38,425
and save the necessary attributes
with the help of holes in the paper.

20
00:01:38,426 --> 00:01:41,200
The snap with the pliers
was very exhausting

21
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:47,413
and also quite imprecise.
That's why he decided to build a

22
00:01:47,414 --> 00:01:53,595
punch which is called
the pantograph.

23
00:01:53,596 --> 00:01:58,736
The punch card is
inserted into the pantograph

24
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:04,023
and by driving back and
forth to the positions

25
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,187
that represent the desired data

26
00:02:07,188 --> 00:02:11,174
perforations are then made.

27
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:16,651
I am now randomly
punching some holes

28
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,624
and you see here twelve
hole positions

29
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:26,067
and horizontally 20 hole positions.
OK!

30
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:30,432
Hollerith has opted
for a punch card format

31
00:02:30,433 --> 00:02:33,707
with twelve rows and 20 columns.

32
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,670
In the following
demo, a total of four

33
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:39,722
hole positions are used for diseases

34
00:02:39,723 --> 00:02:47,353
namely for measles,
tuberculosis, diphtheria and flu.

35
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:54,772
There are also two hole positions for
the male and female characteristics.

36
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:58,887
In the following we use
the two cards "MM" for

37
00:02:58,888 --> 00:03:04,716
measles male and "DiW"
for diphtheria female.

38
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:13,411
Now the card is sensed! And another
one! Oh man, measles epidemic!

39
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:16,936
You can see here
counters for measles

40
00:03:16,937 --> 00:03:22,648
male, tuberculosis,
diphtheria and flu.

41
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:27,563
And the same for women: Measles

42
00:03:27,564 --> 00:03:33,837
female, tuberculosis,
diphtheria and flu. Aha!

43
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:39,432
The base plate of the reader
device has for all available attributes

44
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:46,424
contacts, e.g. for measles,
diphtheria, male and female.

45
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:50,775
The contacts are electrically
connected to the appropriate counters and

46
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:56,114
can be logically
combinded using relays.

47
00:03:56,115 --> 00:03:59,857
The reader device has
spring-loaded pins, which

48
00:03:59,858 --> 00:04:03,384
are also connected
to the counters.

49
00:04:03,385 --> 00:04:06,401
If you insert the punch card and then

50
00:04:06,402 --> 00:04:12,497
press down the lever for sensing,
will be where are holes are located

51
00:04:12,498 --> 00:04:19,298
the circuit be closed and
the counter is increased by one.

52
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,372
Wherever there are no
holes, there is no current

53
00:04:24,373 --> 00:04:29,896
and thus the counters
are not switched on.

54
00:04:30,185 --> 00:04:34,311
Then we still have to
process the other person's data

55
00:04:34,312 --> 00:04:37,928
that's diphtheria female.
And if I

56
00:04:37,929 --> 00:04:41,826
press the reading
station, then you see

57
00:04:41,827 --> 00:04:47,846
that counter seven
jumps by plus one.

58
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:51,558
Hollerith quickly
realized that

59
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:56,330
sorting the cards
is an important step.

60
00:04:56,331 --> 00:05:03,284
Parallel to the card's sensing
and the movement of the counters

61
00:05:03,285 --> 00:05:12,998
in the sorting box flap one opens
for storing the male measles card.

62
00:05:12,999 --> 00:05:20,134
And we can demonstrate
the same with female diphtheria

63
00:05:20,135 --> 00:05:22,835
then compartment seven opens.

64
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:26,465
Now that all the
work is done, you can

65
00:05:26,466 --> 00:05:31,998
take the punch cards
from the sorting compartments

66
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:37,404
and here come the female
cards out and here come the

67
00:05:37,405 --> 00:05:43,787
male cards out. Now if you
want to analyze, where most

68
00:05:43,967 --> 00:05:51,209
measles cases occur, then I
can only take the measles cards

69
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,210
to on another machine
that we

70
00:05:55,215 --> 00:06:00,358
don't have here now, but evaluate
according to this scheme.

71
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:04,410
That means you now have a
stack of male measles, for example

72
00:06:04,411 --> 00:06:09,257
with other attributes like age
for example. Exactly!

73
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:12,167
That means we have pre-sorted
for "male measles"

74
00:06:12,168 --> 00:06:14,934
and with a second machine,
now you can do another

75
00:06:14,935 --> 00:06:17,639
more detailed statistic and ... exactly!

76
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:26,064
In the end Herman Hollerith
achieved his goal! At the 1890 census

77
00:06:26,065 --> 00:06:31,594
the evaluation time was
reduced from ten to just two years.

78
00:06:32,398 --> 00:06:35,935
To achieve this, 500 of his punches
were used to transfer the

79
00:06:35,936 --> 00:06:40,001
the questionnaires
to 62 million punch cards

80
00:06:40,002 --> 00:06:44,209
and then about 90
counting systems dealt with

81
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,203
finally evaluating them.

82
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,241
Last but not least,
with that the new era of

83
00:06:50,242 --> 00:06:53,852
electromechanical data processing began.

84
00:06:53,853 --> 00:06:57,316
A real milestone in IT history!

85
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,318
We thank our lecturer
Heinz Graichen

86
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,532
who together with his companions
in over 2000 working hours

87
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,060
built the statistics piano. By the way,
worldwide

88
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:13,077
there should be only two
of the originals left!

89
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:18,261
Thank you for your attention
and goodbye!
